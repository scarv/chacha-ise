In this paper, we presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of four ISE variants to support ChaCha20 stream cipher on 64-bit RISC-V architecture.
We show that our proposed ISE variants help improve significantly the efficiency of ChaCha block function wrt. both execution latency and memory footprint.  
Our ISE-assisted implementation of ChaCha encryption speeds up at least $5.4\times$ and $3.4\times$ compared to the OpenSSL baseline and ISA-base optimised implementation, respectively. 
For encrypting short messages, the ISE-assisted implementation gains a comparative performance compared to the vectorised implementations which demand a large hardware overhead to support vector instruction extension.
Moreover, the ISE hardware implementation only causes a negligible increased area overhead, about 2\%, on the 64-bit Rocket Core processor that makes our ChaCha ISE be suitable for resource-constrained (embedded) processors.
