In this paper, we presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of three ISE variants to support ChaCha stream cipher on 64-bit RISC-V architecture.
We show that our proposed ISE variants help improve significantly the efficiency of ChaCha block function wrt. both execution latency and memory footprint.  
Our ISE-assisted implementation of ChaCha encryption speeds up at least $5.4\times$ and $3.4\times$ compared to the OpenSSL baseline and ISA-base optimised implementation, respectively. 
For encrypting short messages, the ISE-assisted implementation gains a comparative performance compared to the vectorised implementations which demand a large hardware overhead to support vector instruction extension.
Moreover, the ISE hardware implementation only causes a negligible increased area overhead, about 3\%, on the Rocket Chip system that makes our ChaCha ISE be suitable for resource-constrained processors. While showing potential, the proposed ChaCha ISE needs further investigations in future works to be more generic and efficient for other ARX ciphers.
